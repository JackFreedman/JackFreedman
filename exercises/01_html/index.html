        <p>Dauchsund dogs, or better known as weiner dogs, are one of the coolest dog breeds. People call them weiner dogs because they have a similar shape as a hot dog. They are very small dogs which make them easy to care for compared to bigger dogs like golden retrievers. Plus you can dress them up like hot dogs at halloween which is a cool plus!</p>
