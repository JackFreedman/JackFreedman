        <h3>Dauchsund dogs </h3>
    
        <p>Dauchsund dogs, or better known as weiner dogs, are one of the coolest dog breeds. People call them weiner dogs because they have a similar shape as a hot dog. They are very small dogs which make them easy to care for compared to bigger dogs like golden retrievers. Plus you can dress them up like hot dogs at halloween which is a cool plus!</p>
       <br>
        <p>Dauschund dogs are usually between 16-32 pounds. They have very tiny legs and are around 8 inches tall. Small dogs like these get tired quick so walks are not as long. They are also super great cuddle buddies!</p>
