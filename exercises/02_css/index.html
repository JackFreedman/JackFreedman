        <h1> New York Jets Football</h1>
        <p>The New York Jets are a football team based out of NYC.They have a stadium that is shared with the New York Giants that is in East Rutherford New Jersey. They have 1 superbowl in the franchise history. The last time they made the playoffs was in 2010.</p>
        <p>The Jets have became a far better team within the last 3 years. With players like Sauce Gardner, Garret Wilson, and Aaron Rodgers they are looking to end the drought and make the playoffs this year. The team has a top ranked defense in the league and with a new high powered offense under Aaron Rodgers should be able to make the push!</p>
